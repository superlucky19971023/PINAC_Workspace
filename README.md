## 🚀 Getting Started

This tool is tested on Python `3.10.12`. But this will work very well with other Python versions. But once search on Google for the Python version compatibility with google python modules. But still, if you face any error report it in the `Issues` section.

- **Clone the repository:** Get the masterpiece in your local system by running

- **Activate Google API:** Unlock the power of Google API by following <a href="https://github.com/rajeshtechforge/PINAC_Workspace/blob/main/Google%20API%20Guide.md">our Google API Guide</a>. Don't worry; we've got your back! Dive into the Google API Guide for a smooth setup.

- **Navigate to the Project:** Step into the heart of PINAC-Workspace by navigating to the project directory: `cd PINAC-Workspace`

- **Obtain Your OpenAI API Key:** Once logged in navigate to <a href="https://platform.openai.com/api-keys">the API Keys section </a> and generate a new key.
 
- **Create the .env File** Inside your project's /src/configs directory, create a new file named .env. It's important to note that this file is typically ignored by version control systems (like Git) to prevent accidental exposure of your secret key.

- **Set the Environment Variable:** Open the .env file in a text editor and add the following line, replacing **<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>** with your actual key:
**OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>**


- **Prepare Your Machine**: Create the **Virtual Environment** by the name `venv` and activate it by running
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
  Hey, your workspace is ready! Now just install dependencies by running the command 
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
